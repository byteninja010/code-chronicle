# Requirements Document: CodeChronicle

## Introduction

CodeChronicle is an AI-powered VS Code extension designed to help developers understand and safely modify large legacy codebases. The extension scans the local workspace, constructs a deterministic dependency graph, and layers AWS AI-driven reasoning on top to explain file responsibilities, assess risk, and predict the impact of changes before they are made. The core principle is that static analysis provides reliable structure while AI provides semantic understanding.

## Glossary

- **Extension**: The CodeChronicle VS Code extension
- **Workspace**: The currently open VS Code workspace containing source code files
- **Code_Graph**: A directed graph representation where nodes are files and edges are dependencies
- **Node**: A file in the workspace represented as a graph vertex
- **Edge**: A dependency relationship between files (imports, requires, includes)
- **Structural_Metric**: A deterministically computed metric such as dependency count, centrality, or lines of code
- **Risk_Factor**: An AI-assigned semantic risk score based on business logic, side effects, security sensitivity, and hidden coupling
- **Blast_Radius**: The set of all files that transitively depend on a given file
- **Webview**: A VS Code webview panel that renders the interactive graph visualization using React.js and TailwindCSS
- **User**: A developer using the CodeChronicle extension
- **AI_Service**: AWS Bedrock Foundation Models used for semantic analysis and natural language processing
- **Cloud_Backend**: AWS Lambda functions orchestrated via API Gateway for AI processing
- **Graph_Store**: Amazon DynamoDB for AI summaries, risk scores, and file hashes; Amazon Neptune for large-scale graph storage
- **Artifact_Store**: Amazon S3 for storing graph snapshots and analysis artifacts

## Requirements

4. WHEN a file is discovered, THE Extension SHALL record its path relative to the Workspace root
5. WHEN scanning completes, THE Extension SHALL notify the User of the total number of files discovered

### Requirement 2: Dependency Detection and Graph Construction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to detect file dependencies deterministically, so that I can trust the accuracy of the dependency graph.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing a source file, THE Extension SHALL extract import statements using language-specific regex patterns
2. WHEN an import statement references a local file, THE Extension SHALL create an Edge from the importing file to the imported file

4. WHEN Cloud_Backend returns analysis, THE Extension SHALL store the risk assessment in DynamoDB with the file hash
5. WHEN Cloud_Backend fails, THE Extension SHALL fall back to Structural_Metrics only and notify the User

### Requirement 5: Interactive Graph Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see an interactive visual representation of the codebase inside VS Code, so that I can explore dependencies intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN a User clicks on a Node, THE Extension SHALL display file details in a side panel

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered File Summaries

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see AI-generated explanations of what each file does, so that I can quickly understand unfamiliar code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User clicks on a Node, THE Extension SHALL request a summary from Cloud_Backend via API Gateway
2. WHEN requesting a summary, THE Extension SHALL provide file contents and Code_Graph context to Cloud_Backend
3. WHEN Cloud_Backend invokes AWS Bedrock and returns a summary, THE Extension SHALL display it in the Webview side panel
4. WHEN a summary is generated, THE Extension SHALL store it in DynamoDB with the file hash to avoid redundant API calls
5. WHEN Cloud_Backend fails, THE Extension SHALL display Structural_Metrics and raw file metadata instead

### Requirement 7: Blast Radius Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see which files depend on a selected file, so that I can assess the impact of potential changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User selects a Node and activates Blast_Radius mode, THE Extension SHALL compute all transitive dependents using local graph or query Amazon Neptune for large-scale graphs
2. WHEN Blast_Radius is computed, THE Extension SHALL highlight all dependent Nodes in the Webview
3. WHEN Blast_Radius is displayed, THE Extension SHALL request an impact analysis from Cloud_Backend
4. WHEN Cloud_Backend invokes AWS Bedrock and returns impact analysis, THE Extension SHALL display potential breaking changes in the side panel
5. WHEN Blast_Radius mode is deactivated, THE Extension SHALL restore the original visualization state

### Requirement 8: Natural Language Query Interface
